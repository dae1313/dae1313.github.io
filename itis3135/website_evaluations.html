            <h3 class="goodsitetitle"><a href="https://www.ally.com/">Ally</a></h3>
            <p>This website is an online banking that offers different services from checking, savings, mortgage, retirment, and personal loans.</p>
            <ul class="goodcrap">
                <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>The website uses mainly white and purple colors which enhances its visual appeal and ensures readability. The site also 
                    uses vibrant colors and different font sizes for important information and the call to action buttons to make it more noticeable to users.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Each time the user navigates to a different page, the logo and the navigation menu consistently appears in the same position 
                    including the login button which is at the top of the website. Also the footer section and the dropdown menu containing links to different sections 
                    remain consistent throughout the website which makes it easier for the user to easily navigate and remember where stuff is.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The layout is well-aligned and organized. For example, the navigation menu and the social media icons in the footer 
                    section are aligned horizontally and are evenly spaced out. The grid on the website makes the content evenly aligned. This creates a visual appeal and user-friendly interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>On the website, the links are organized into categories in the drop down menu. This makes it easier for the user to find the information without having 
                    to search it up. The navigation menu is placed closely together which makes it easier for the user to locate the information quickly.</li>    
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="badsite">
            <h3 class="badsitetitle"><a href="https://www.lingscars.com">Lingscars</a></h3>
            <p>This is a car dealership website. The site offers a wide range of car deals and car leasing options.</p>
            <ul class="badcrap">
                <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>The background color on the website is a bit overwhelming and can distract the user when exploring the site. It also uses bold colors and gif 
                    throughout the website which can be distracting. At the bottom of the page, it uses too much white space which makes it look unprofessional.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>The picture of the owner, the title of the website, and the menu navigation remained in the same position throughout the website. 
                    The site contained some unnecessary repetition information and unique designs throughout the site. This leads to confusion and lack of visual consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The text and images are not aligned which makes the site look unorganized and unprofessional. Each of the social media icons are positioned in different locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Everything is so close together including the unrelated ones. This leads to issues like overcrowding, lack of spacing, and visual clutter. This makes it harder for 
                    users to navigate and understand the content.</li>
            </ul>
